This project aims to be a strong foundation for react-native applications. It provides a clear and organized structure, core dependencies, and boilerplate to jumpstart development.

## Usage

Use the following script to generate a fresh React Native project with additional components already included. 
Replace `AwesomeProject` with your app name.

```
npx react-native init AwesomeProject --template mdmush/react-native-template
```

## Folder structure

This template follows a straightforward project structure:

- `Routes.tsx`: Main component that starts your whole app.
- `index.js`: Entry point of your application as per React-Native standards.
- `android`: Contains all the native Android code.
- `ios`: Contains all the native iOS code.
- `src`: This folder is the main container of all the code inside your application.
  - `assets`: Folder to store all images, fonts, etc.
  - `components`: Folder to store any common component used throughout your app (such as Header, Screen, etc.).
  - `constants`: Folder to store any constants.
  - `tab-screens`: Folder containing all the screens used in tabs.
  - `screens`: Folder containing all your application screens, e.g., `Splashscreen.tsx`
  - `store`: Folder for Redux middlewares, the store, and Redux Toolkit slices (such as `userSlice.ts`).

## Generate production version

These are the steps to generate `.apk`, `.aab` and `.ipa` files

### Android

2. Setting up gradle variables
3. Go to the android folder
4. Execute `./gradlew assemble[Env][BuildType]`

Note: You have three options to execute the project
`assemble:` Generates an apk that you can share with others.
`install:` When you want to test a release build on a connected device.
`bundle:` When you are uploading the app to the Play Store.
